## Overview

Good financial habits are the foundation of a successful life. But what is a good financial habit? It's a question of personal preference, not a set of rules. However, a lot of successful people recommend that you do a few things every day as far as money goes. The thing is, being alive EXPENSIVE. Expensive is the right word. It comes from the term EXPENSE. As long as you are alive, you are going to be spending something, mostly money. So let us start there, with the expense of living.

## Budget

Your spending habits should be defined by and constrained to your budget. At the end of every single day, you should be consiously and unconsiously aware of how much money you have spent. It should not be "I think/guess I have spent X amount of money today". You should be aware of how much money you spent in a given day, even a fortnight ago. "I spent 500 Kenya shillings on Tuesday, March 8th, and this is where it went: KES 300 on food, KES 100 on fare, and KES 100 on internet bundles". So, develop the habit of setting your daily budget every single month.
